# TP-roguelike

This project has been realised in the scope of the UE Programmation Orient√©e Objet (Object Oriented Programming). 
Given a squeletton, we were to modify it to fit the MVC model and UML-related knowledge that we studied in class and implement new fonctionnalities to practice coding in Java.

We tried to use GitHub board ("Projects" tab) to organize ourselves but ended doing a lot of peer-coding and not needing it that much. 

We used IntelliJ to compile and run the project.
